# Incident Response — Mini Case Studies

## Goals
- Show end-to-end IR workflow using **NIST 800-61**: Preparation → Detection/Analysis → Containment/Eradication/Recovery → Post-Incident.

## How to Use This Folder
- Each case is one markdown file in `/reports/` with timestamps, evidence links, and decisions.
- Include screenshots from SIEM or endpoints under `/screenshots/`.

## Template
See `reports/_template.md` for a starter.
