## 📂 Featured projects

| Project | Description | Link |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vulnerability Assessment: Ubuntu VM (DVWA, Juice Shop and Vulhub)** | Scanned intentionally vulnerable apps with nmap and OpenVAS, prioritised risks by CVSS, produced remediation reports. | [View project](./01-vuln-assessment-ubuntu/) |
| **Web Application Penetration Testing: OWASP Juice Shop** | Tested against OWASP Top 10 using Burp Suite and ZAP, documented exploitation techniques and recommended improvements. | [View project](./02-web-pentest-juice-shop/) |
| **Active Directory Domain Setup** | Built a Windows Server AD domain, created OUs and users, applied baseline Group Policy. | [View project](./03-ad-setup/) |
| **Active Directory Attack and Hardening** | Mapped attack paths with BloodHound, demonstrated Kerberoasting and password spraying, then applied hardening and re-tested. | [View project](./04-ad-attack-hardening/) |
| **SIEM Deployment and Log Analysis: Wazuh and ELK** | Deployed Wazuh, ingested Windows and Linux logs, created custom detection rules for suspicious behaviour. | [View project](./05-siem-wazuh/) |
| **Threat Hunting with Sigma rules** | Wrote Sigma rules and ran hunts for lateral movement, persistence and credential access. | [View project](./06-threat-hunting-sigma/) |
| **Incident Response Simulation** | Simulated a small incident, triaged, contained and recovered, produced a clear timeline and report. | [View project](./07-incident-response-sim/) |
| **Phishing Simulation and Detection** | Built a safe phishing exercise, validated email authentication, added SIEM alerts. | [View project](./08-phishing-sim-detection/) |
| **Malware Analysis: Static and Dynamic** | Analysed a safe sample, captured process and network behaviour, extracted IOCs and suggested detections. | [View project](./09-malware-analysis/) |
| **Cloud Security Lab: AWS or Azure** | Reproduced a public storage misconfiguration, enabled logging, and applied least privilege IAM. | [View project](./10-cloud-security-aws-azure/) |
| **CTF or TryHackMe Walkthroughs** | Clean, structured write ups showing methodology and learning. | [View project](./11-ctf-walkthroughs-optional/) |
