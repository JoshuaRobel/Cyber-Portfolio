# Vulnerability Management — Greenbone/OpenVAS

## Goals
- Scan target hosts, triage findings, and produce remediation guidance.

## Setup
- Ubuntu ARM64 VM running **Greenbone Community Edition** (Docker recommended on ARM).
- Targets: Metasploitable2 (or vulnerable test Windows/Linux host).

## Workflow
1. Deploy Greenbone → create target(s) and schedule a task.
2. Run authenticated and unauthenticated scans (where possible).
3. Export report → analyze Top 5 issues by CVSS and exploitability.
4. Document remediation plan and quick wins.

## Deliverables
- `sample-report/` (screenshots or redacted PDF summary).
- `README.md` with triage table (ID, CVSS, affected, remediation, owner).
